<div id="exp" style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Arbutus Slab', serif;font-size: 20px; padding-right:20px; padding-left:20px;" >
I mainly consider myself a front end developer and a back end developer. My knowledge includes Javascript(mainly Angular.JS and React.JS), HTML5, 
and CSS. For back end, I know Node.JS, MYSQL,SQLite, and in addition to having the knowledge of how to set up REST API's and using Express. 
Other languages that I know include Java, C, Python,and Matlab. My other interest includes photography and because of this, my skill set 
also includes photoshop and lightroom. You can see some of my actual work experience and other coding projects that I have 
done down below. 
<br>
In addition to these skills, the fact that I have attended various hackathons has also helped me to work in a team environment. I have worked, both in a waterfall 
and agile working environments. This has contributed to my experience of not only, working in a team of devlopers, but also with UX/UI designers and various types of 
business majors to execute and deliver projects based on the given challenges and assigments. Feel free to check out my resume to see my projects
and the hackathons that I have attended.

  display a general image of Atlanta. A controller is used to route scope values to the carasoul and the Google maps display since Angular's
  routing is being used. The application is using AngluarJS UI-Routing system to render out each seaprate page.The application is still a single page application 
  with no page reloads unless a external link is clicked.</td>
